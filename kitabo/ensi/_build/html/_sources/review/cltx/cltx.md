### Latent profiles of deceased organ donation registrants and non-registrants in the United States
- Survey of 11,083 persons, place, time
- Latent profile analysis (unsupervised machine learning) to identify factors associated with registration
- Yielded three profiles
   - Meaningful differences across these three included:
      - Access to healthcare services
      - Satisfaction with those services
      - Mental health
      - Age (not as a standalone variable)
         - Healthy and young had lowest registration rates
         - Cited low priority and distrust of the process of donation
- `Transparency`, or lack thereof, of these methods is a potential issue`
