"Regional Disparities in Kidney Transplant Allocation in Brazil" presents a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of kidney transplant allocation disparities. While the academic rigor of the work is commendable, the style of reporting is ambiguous about whether the authors seek to describe the clinical relevance of their findings or whether they seek to make a public health statement and possible intervention.

The meticulous approach is evident in the detailed reporting of outcomes by various risk factors, presented through univariable, adjusted hazard ratios (HR), and adjusted subdistribution hazard ratios (sHR). The aesthetically pleasing cumulative incidence curves further illustrate these findings, albeit they parallel the unvariable HR from the tables making the output redundant.

Venturing into highly academic spheres of mediation analyses welcome. And finding that only 0.5% of "effects" are mediated by region is just as well, if "region" as a risk-factor is the focal point of the paper. But the reader has to put this also in context of the other risk factors, several with HRs that are statistically significant but are close to 1 (e.g. gender and ethnicity); while others such as time on dialysis are difficult to interpret in a clinical setting (e.g. what does HR=0.97 mean for someone who has been on dialysis for 5 years?). 

On the other hand, there are striking risk factors such as cPRA > 90% with HR=0.29, north region with HR = 2.53. So regardless of mediation analysis or statistical significance of a given risk factor, these characteristics will have very noteworthy implication in a given clinical scenario that combines values of the entire range of risk factors into something digestible for a given patient and their care provider who seek to make a decision. No patient or careprovider is testing a hypothesis on an isolated risk factor that isn't under the control of the patient, such as region.

But if the authors seek a public health intervention with a focus on regions, then much of the analytic output is way too distracting. So a more focused narrative would help the reader.

To enhance the clinical relevance of your study, we recommend focusing on absolute risks for about three select clinical scenarios of the authors' choosing. This approach would be more relatable and practical for average clinicians who need to communicate effectively with their patients. Not the numerous univariable absolute risks that duplicate what is reported in the tables. Even if you provided a base-case cumulative incidence curve for the readers, they'd have trouble applying all the other adjusted sHRs for each clinical scenario they encounter and have to discuss risks with.

Also, please define the primary outcome as the time-dependent probability of receiving a kidney transplant, rather than merely "the odds" (terms you use in you introduction and methods). 

By incorporating absolute risk estimates for a few select clinical scenarios, your study will significantly enhance its practical impact. These additions will make your findings more relatable and actionable for clinicians and patients alike, bridging the gap between rigorous academic research and everyday clinical practice.

We look forward to the revised manuscript incorporating these recommendations.
