1. "Regional Disparities in Kidney Transplant Allocation in Brazil" presents a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of kidney transplant allocation disparities. While the academic rigor of the work is commendable, the style of reporting is ambiguous about whether the authors seek to describe the statistical significance of their findings, the clinical relevance,  or whether they seek to make a public health statement and possible intervention. For instance, if only 0.5% of observed effects are mediated by geographical region, why is it "urgent" to implement approaches to enhance transplant capacity in the North region? On the other hand, if a care-provider is communicating the likelihood of transplantation to an individual from the North, then surely a sHR of 0.38 is all that matters (not the metric from mediation analysis).

2. The meticulous approach is evident in the detailed reporting of outcomes by various risk factors, presented through univariable, adjusted hazard ratios (HR), and adjusted subdistribution hazard ratios (sHR). The aesthetically pleasing cumulative incidence curves further illustrate these findings, albeit they parallel the univariable HR from the tables, making the output redundant. What is the purpose of reporting so many metrics that it makes interpretation difficult for the average clinician? Why univariable HR, aHR from Cox regression, and sHR from competing risks? Are all conveying information central to the narrative? Can the reporting be more focused?

3. If  the reader has to put the findings of this paper in the context of their entire clinical profile rather than adjusted risk factors, critical issues emerge. First, several risk-factors have HRs that are statistically significant but close to 1 (e.g., gender and ethnicity). Others, such as time on dialysis, are difficult to interpret in a clinical setting (e.g., what does HR=0.97 for someone who has been on dialysis for 5 years?). On the other hand, there are striking risk factors such as cPRA > 90% with HR=0.29,  south region with HR=2.53, and north region (HR=0.38).  So regardless of mediation analysis or statistical significance of a given risk factor, these characteristics will have very noteworthy implications in a given clinical scenario, which is the combination of all these risk factors and interactions. No patient or care provider is testing a hypothesis on an isolated risk factor that isn't under the control of the patient, such as region. So the authors should keep their narrative informative by clarifying the context they wish to inform. If the authors seek a public health intervention with a focus on regions, then much of the analytic output is way too distracting. A more focused narrative would help the reader.

This work is analytically rigorous, but the authors don't seem to be sure about what exactly they wish to report. The analytic output is a bit too much and often redundant. 

To enhance the clinical relevance of their study (if their goal isn't more about public health relevance), we may recommend a focus on absolute risks for about three select clinical scenarios of the authors' choosing. 

This approach would be more relatable and practical for average clinicians who need to communicate effectively with their patients. Not the numerous univariable absolute risks that duplicate what is reported in the tables. These are isolated risk-factors, and so they don't speak to any clinical scenario, which is always a combination of risk-factors. 

And one minor issue: the authors define the primary outcome in both their introduction and methods section as "the odds", which is relatable. But technically, they quantify probabilities that vary with time on dialysis (i.e., cumulative incidence from a well-defined time point). 

To summarize, if the authors incorporate absolute risk estimates for a few interesting clinical scenarios, the approach will significantly enhance its practical impact. These additions will make the findings more relatable and actionable for clinicians and patients alike, bridging the gap between rigorous academic research and everyday clinical practice.

But if they wish to focus on a public health message about region variations in risk, then the approach should be very different from the one taken in the first submission.
